## Description
`Push_swap` program sorts a list of integers using a set of predefined stack operations.
- Duplicates and non-numeric inputs will cause an error.
- The goal is to sort the list using the least amount of moves possible.
- This version acepts numbers in strings.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the program:
```sh
make
```
- This will generate the push_swap executable..

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run push_swap with a list of numbers
```sh
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```
Example Output:
```sh
pb
pb
ra
sa
pa
pa
```
- The output consists of the sequence of operations needed to sort the numbers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check if the output is correct using the checker:
#### First, compile the checker program
```sh
make bonus
```
Then, use it to validate the output of push_swap:
```sh
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

Expected Output:
```
OK
```
- If the output is "KO", it means the sorting algorithm did not work correctly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Count the number of operations:
### To check how many operations push_swap is using, run:
```sh
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
```
- This will display the number of moves required to sort the list.
